## 🔎 Key Analytical Insights

### 🌍 Regional Performance

-   South region drives the highest revenue and order volume.
-   Revenue dominance in South is volume-driven rather than
    discount-driven.
-   East region underperforms in revenue but shows strong average order
    value, indicating growth potential.

### 👥 Customer Segmentation

-   26--35 age group generates the highest revenue.
-   46--55 age group delivers the highest profit margin (\~14.95%),
    making it the most valuable segment.
-   Younger customers (18--25) contribute lower revenue but maintain
    healthy margins.

### 💸 Discount Impact

-   A moderate negative correlation (-0.489) exists between discount and
    profit.
-   Discounts above \~20--25% frequently reduce profitability.
-   Indicates margin erosion due to aggressive discounting.

### 🔮 Trend & Forecasting

-   Monthly revenue trends were analyzed.
-   A 3-month moving average model was applied to identify short-term
    revenue direction.
